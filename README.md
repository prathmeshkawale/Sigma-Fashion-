        <p><i>In 1984, Nike was in trouble. Growth had stalled, profits were down and a misjudged move intog left it with piles of unsold inventory. Rivals had beaten it to new crazes for aerobics and leisure shoes.<br> Sales fell. “Orwell was right,” Phil Knight, who was chairman and chief executive, began his annual letter to shareholders. “1984 was a tough year.”<br>

            But Air, a new film set in that same year, opens this week, and shows how Nike went on to become the world’s No 1 shoe and sports brand, a company whose revenue topped £37bn in 2022.<br>
            
            It’s directed by and stars Ben Affleck as Knight in all his shell-suit and mirrored shades-wearing, purple Porsche-driving 80s pomp. Air also stars Matt Damon as Sonny Vaccaro, a Nike sports marketing executive in desperate need of a hit. But the real star of this story is the Air Jordan shoe.<br>
            
            Air tells how, against everyone’s advice, Vaccaro signed a sponsorship deal with the rookie basketball player Michael Jordan, luring him away from more viable rivals Adidas and Converse, by presenting him with his own sneaker – the Air Jordan.<br> Even more controversially, at the behest of Jordan’s formidable mother,<br> Deloris (played in the film by Viola Davis), he gave Jordan points on every pair sold, kicking off a revolution in the way sport and its stars were marketed around the world.</i></p>
